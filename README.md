## Overview

The Ranosys Notification Manager is an extension of the Adobe Commerce Admin UI SDK that enhances the Commerce Admin interface by allowing administrators to schedule and display timeâ€‘bound notifications in both the page header and footer.

## Features

- **Flexible Scheduling**: Create and schedule multiple notifications with specific start and end dates and times.
- **Separate Header & Footer Control**: Independently manage notification sets for the header and the footer, ensuring targeted messaging in each area.
- **Easy Management**: Intuitive Admin UI integration makes it simple to add, edit, enable, or disable notifications without writing any custom code.
